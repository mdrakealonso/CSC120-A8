I decided to make a Spellcaster class! I thought this seemed appropriate given that magical powers would explain the ability to fly and shrink / grow. A Spellcaster can fly using a broom, walk, grow in size using a growth potion, shrink using a shrinking one... Unlike flying, walking takes energy. This energy can be increased slightly by food, and replenished with an energy elixer or by simply resting. Spellcasters can also examine items or grab them and them to their inventory. They can also drop items from their inventory. Overall, I had fun thinking of how to make each method fit with my class. I only added one method: eat(). But I also decided to make a seperate Item class to have the option of setting the name and type for an item. I did this so I could determine if an item is food or a potion for growth, etc. and use that information to make the methods more effective. In particular, creating this seperate Item class helped me in writing if-else statements. I would suggest that others just have fun with this assignment and create something they enjoy :D This concept is not too different from some that we've learned so far, so I think this is a good opportunity to put what we've been learning into practice.
